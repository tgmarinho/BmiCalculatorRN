# BMI Calculator 💪

## Our Goal

The objective is create the same app that [Angela Bauer](https://github.com/angelabauer) did with [Flutter](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/bmi-calculator-flutter), but instead of using Flutter I am using React Native.

## Check it out

We’re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
